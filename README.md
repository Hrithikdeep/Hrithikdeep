# Hi, I’m Hrithik 👋  
**Data Science & Generative AI engineer**

Bachelor of Computer Applications graduate skilled in Python, ML, LLMs, Streamlit, and GitHub workflows. I build real‑world AI products and APIs from scratch—including document‑driven Q&A, NER, predictive modeling, and more.

---

## 🔧 What I Build (Projects & AI Infrastructure)

- **📄 RAG‑PDF Q&A App**: Upload PDFs, chunk and embed text with HuggingFace, store with FAISS, and generate smart answers using **Groq LLM** via LangChain.  
  *Live on Streamlit Cloud → [https://rag-app-langchain-groq-jmv7qhq4cpfyzaj9zahwlb.streamlit.app/]* • *Code → *

- **🔍 Data & ML Projects**: End‑to‑end pipelines including cleaning, modeling, and visualization—proficient with Pandas, Scikit‑Learn, NumPy, Matplotlib.

- **🤖 AI Tooling & Automation**: Internal tools using Streamlit, APIs, Groq/LLM, and vector search integrations for knowledge retrieval and summarization.
